* Improves StateInterface implementation of the DummyInterface.
  The doesLoopBack() method now returns the correct value. A state change is
  correctly dispatched when the init() method is called.
* Changes inheritance of DummyInterface to DriverInterface.
  Such that this interface can also be used for tests requiring a DriverInterface
  class.
  Test results of the socketcan_interface tests are unchanged by this
  modification as it only uses the CommInterface methods.
* added socketcan_interface_string to test
* moved string functions into separate lib
* Introduced setNotReady, prevent enqueue() to switch from closed to open
