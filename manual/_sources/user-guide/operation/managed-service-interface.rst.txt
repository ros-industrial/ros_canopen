Managed Service Interface 
============================


Device Container with managed nodes
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
The device container implements ROS2 component manager. The load and unload services are disabled.
Devices are loaded based on the Bus Configuration File (bus.yml). The device container provides
the list service, which can be used with ros2cli to check which components have been loaded.

The device container uses the bus description file to identify the correct drivers for each devices.
On launch it will load the CANopen master node and driver nodes and pass the appropriate configuration
data to the nodes. The nodes are now in unconfigured state.

When using the default launch files in canopen_core the lifecycle manager node will automatically
be launched. The lifecycle manager takes care of sequencing the lifecycle of the different nodes in the
device container. By bringing the lifecycle_manager to active lifecycle state, all master and driver nodes
will be activated in correct sequence.

If you choose to write your own lifecycle_manager, you'll need to remember, that the master needs
to be configured and activated before any driver node can be configured or activated.


Bus Configuration
"""""""""""""""""
The bus configuration for the managed service interface needs to use the driver classes that are marked as
lifecycle drivers. The master driver indicates whether the bus.yml will be treated as managed or un-managed
service interface.

Launching
"""""""""""""
The device manager has the following configuration parameters.

.. csv-table:: Parameters
   :header: "Parameter", "Type", "Description"

    bus_conf, string, (Mandatory) Path to the bus configuration YAML-file
    master_dcf, string, (Mandatory) Path to the DCF file to be used by the master node. Usually generated by dcfgen as master.dcf.
    master_bin, string, (Optional) Path to the concise DCF (.bin) file to be used to configure the master. Usually generated by dcfgen as master.bin. (default: "")
    can_interface, string, (Mandatory) Name of the CAN interface to be used. (default: vcan0)
